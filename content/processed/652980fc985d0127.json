Reasoning is how you teach LLMs to think.”\nAs LLMs become more deeply integrated into business and product workflows, mastering\nhow\nto guide them becomes as important as knowing\nwhat\nto ask.\nToday, we explore three foundational\nreasoning techniques\nthat unlock new levels of clarity, accuracy, and intelligence from LLMs:\nWhat Are They?\n1. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting\nEncourages the model to “think out loud” by walking through intermediate steps.\nBest for:\nMath, logic, and multi-step reasoning.\nThink:\n“Step 1: calculate X. Step 2: add Y to X. Step 3: Result.”\nOrigin:\nWei et al., 2022 (Google)\n2. ReAct (Reason + Act) Prompting\nCombines CoT reasoning with tool-like action((search, verify, calculate)) steps, allowing the LLM to simulate interactions (e.g., retrieval, search, tool use).\nBest for:\nDecision support, planning, or tasks needing evidence or verification.\nThink:\n“Thought: I need data on X → Action: Search → Thought: Based on that, I choose Y.”\nOrigin:\nYao et al., 2022 —\nLink to paper\n3. Tree-of-Thought (ToT) Prompting\nSimulates multiple reasoning branches before reaching a decision — much like weighing trade-offs or options.\nBest for:\nStrategic analysis, evaluations, planning, or choices involving pros and cons.\nThink:\n“Option A: Pros & Cons. Option B: Pros & Cons. Now compare and decide.”\nOrigin:\nLong et al., 2023 (DeepMind & Princeton) —\nLink to paper\nReal-World Experiments\nTask 1: Chain-of-Thought (Math Reasoning)\nPrompting for precision:\nPrompt Template:\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\nExample\nA bakery sold 120 muffins in the morning, 80 in the afternoon, and 150 in the evening.\nHow many muffins in total?

  "key_insights": [
    "Галлюцинации — это не баг модели, это результат плохого промтинга",
    "RAG: векторная база + запрос → модель отвечает на реальных данных, не выдумывает",
    "CoT: разбивай сложный вопрос на шаги, чтобы увидеть где модель ошибается",
    "ReAct: модель САМА решает когда нужен дополнительный поиск",
    "DSP: добавляй хинты ('фокусируйся на X', 'игнорируй Y') для точных ответов",
    "Комбинация: RAG → CoT → DSP = максимальная точность"
  ],
  "practical_example": "Вместо 'What was our revenue?' → RAG достаёт данные, CoT разбивает по категориям, DSP фокусирует на нужном периоде",
