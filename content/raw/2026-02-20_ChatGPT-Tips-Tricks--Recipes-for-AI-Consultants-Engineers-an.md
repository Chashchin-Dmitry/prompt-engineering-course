ChatGPT is powerful, but it’s also a bit like having a talented assistant who sometimes needs a nudge in the right direction.

This article is about bridging that gap, sharing a few tips, tricks, and practical recipes that can help you get the most out of ChatGPT, whether you’re an AI consultant, engineer, or developer.

Some of these might be the exact solution you’re looking for, while others could surprise you later with their usefulness.

Nudging ChatGPT for Specificity

ChatGPT can be vague if you don’t steer it.

Imagine you ask it to “Explain neural networks.”

You’ll get a decent answer, but it won’t be tailored to the level of detail you might need for a meeting with a fellow developer or a client who’s new to AI.

You must guide ChatGPT.

Try this: When you need a more specific answer, anchor it with “Explain neural networks like I’m preparing for a technical presentation” or “Explain neural networks to a business executive.”
