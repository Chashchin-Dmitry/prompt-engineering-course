Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Model Context Protocol (MCP) form the foundational building blocks of autonomous systems. This article systematically examines the theoretical foundations, architectural integration, practical applications, and future implications of these three technologies. Moving beyond prompt engineering, it explores the transformative potential of agentic intelligence at industrial scale from an academic perspective.

Theoretical Foundations and Technology Triad

Large Language Models (LLMs) are transformer-based, parameter-dense systems; models like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Llama 3 provide natural language processing (NLP) capabilities that serve as the cognitive core of AI agents. AI agents extend LLMs through the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) loop, implementing a perception-cognition-action-memory architecture: they perceive environmental data, generate plans, and execute autonomous actions. MCP (Model Context Protocol), an open standard protocol developed by Anthropic, standardizes agents’ JSON-based, OAuth2-secured interactions with databases, APIs, and external tools.

This triad forms a hierarchical ecosystem: LLMs reason, agents enable cyclical autonomy, and MCP delivers plug-and-play scalability…
