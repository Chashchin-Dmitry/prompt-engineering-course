Agent engineering is what happens when prompt engineering stops working
We didn’t “get bad at prompting.” We crossed a line where language stopped being the hard part.

For a solid year, prompt engineering felt like a superpower.

You could whisper the right incantation into a text box and suddenly the model behaved. Cleaner output. Better reasoning. Less hallucination. People were trading prompts like Pokémon cards. Entire careers popped up around

“just knowing how to talk to the model.”

Then agents showed up.

Same models. Same prompts. Totally different chaos.

I remember the first time I gave an agent a simple task, walked away, came back later… and realized it was still going. Not stuck. Not crashed. Just confidently doing the wrong thing over and over like a Roomba trapped between two chair legs, but burning tokens instead of carpet.

That’s when it clicked: this wasn’t a prompting problem anymore.

This felt uncomfortably familiar. Like the first time you deployed something that worked locally, mostly worked in staging, and then quietly ate itself in production while smiling in the logs. Prompt tweaks didn’t help. Better wording…
